# Purpose
The House Style Guide is used as a supplement to the Chicago Manual of Style and Merriam Webster's Dictionary. 

## Champion clarity and avoid jargon. 
Write clearly and don't assume your jargon is a shared vocabulary with the customer. Clarity avoids confusing your reader, and gets to the point more quickly. 


Save space, avoid confusion, sell more.


# Clarity example:

Unclear and jargon heavy:
The Particle Electron is an IoT dev kit running Device OS and with support for Device Cloud OTA. 


Rewrite for clarity:
The Electron is a prototyping kit for building connected cellular projects.  
	



## Use the Serial comma

### Serial comma example:

* Needs a comma: The Argon, Boron and Xenon are all mesh-ready devices.
* Serial comma: The Argon, Boron, and Xenon are all mesh-ready devices.
	


# Being clear is different than being exhaustive
Copy length matters. Set a word count range for your writing and hit it. A successful post is not one that says everything there is to say on a subject. Rather it's saying the most important things and keeping the reader interested. 


_Note: SEO best practises for blogging say a post should be at least 300 words._
	

Use the table below as a point of reference for your copy length. 

**Blog post:** 300-500 words and shares a short story, interview, or product feature. If this were in a magazine it would take up a page or a page and a half if image heavy.


**Feature post:** 1,000-2,000 words and dives deep on a customer story, a how-to project In a magazine this would span multiple pages and be an anchor to the the of the issue.
	



## Use you and your. Avoid we.
The customer is the hero, not our hardware and not our software. Follow this rule when writing for the blog and emails.


### Example:
Email example from the December 2018 Developer Newsletter:

See how Gustavo Gonnet ported myRelay to support Particle third-generation hardware. The project lets you control relays — fancy mechanical switches — from the tap of your mobile phone.

## I use I and so should you. 
When writing a blog post or email it is appropriate and encouraged to use I. 


### Examples:
Here's how I built a Particle-powered project using an Argon.


	

### Product names 
Product names on first mention should link to the product landing page in the store.

### SoM tips
E Series is a product family name that should never be hyphenated nor represented as a product itself. The same is true for the A, B, and X Series devices.


A Series
B Series
X Series
E Series

## Abbreviations
Abbreviations should be written out long-form on their first mention with their abbreviation provided in parentheses unless the abbreviation is better known than the long-form.


**Note:** IoT, SoM, and OTA are common exceptions where the abbreviation is widely known. However, there may be SEO considerations where it is advantageous to write out long-form even for these commonly understood abbreviations.


## Avoid possessive forms of the company and product names 


### Examples:
* Bad: Particle's new Boron dev kit is great for building connected projects.
* OK: The Particle Boron is a dev kit for building connected projects.
* Better: The Boron is a dev kit for building connected projects.
	
**Note:** Use the OK version when you are writing for an external site where there could be potential confusion of whose Boron. When writing for company properties, avoid overloading the copy with Particle — of course it's a Particle product, it's on the Particle website. 


## Use an article or pronoun before a dev kit name. 

* The Argon is a Wi-Fi connected dev kit.


* To get the most out of your Argon, make sure you have access to a good Wi-Fi signal.
	

## Headline styling
All headlines must follow sentence-case.

### Example:
* Traditional headline, not used at Particle: 
 Announcing Device OS 1.0 and Release Guidelines for Product Creators

* Sentence-case headline: 
Announcing Device OS 1.0 and release guidelines for product creators
	
**Note:** The blog automatically sets headlines to all capitals; however, RSS readers do not get this styling treatment. As a result, you must use sentence case and not rely on the blog CSS. 
	

**Note:** Headline styling is an example where the house style guide supersedes the Chicago Manual of Style.
	

## Sections (H2 and up)
* Subheadings should be sentence-case. CSS will capitalize them for you. This will help future-proof the copy should maters of style change.
